Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as a way
to provide information and assistance to users in various
domains. However, most chatbots rely on pre-defined scripts or large language models (LLMs) that may not have access to the latest or most relevant information for a specific context. In this project, we propose ChatSNC, a chatbot that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to chat with the website content of a college. RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation, allowing AI models to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge source and incorporate it into generated text. ChatSNC uses RAG to query the college website and generate responses that are grounded on the official and up-to-date information of the college. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatSNC by comparing it with a baseline chatbot that only uses an LLM without retrieval. We show that ChatSNC can provide more accurate, informative, and engaging responses than the baseline chatbot, and can handle a variety of user queries related to the college.
